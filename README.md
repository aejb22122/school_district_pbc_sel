Analysis of the determinants of youths succes in Palm Beach County schools

This study examined school data for 15,223 grade K-8 youth enrolled in out-of-school time (OST) programs participating in the Palm Beach County Quality Improvement System (QIS). OST program-related characteristics (program quality, level of experience in QIS and level of community socioeconomic need) and youth characteristics (gender and age) were used to predict youth social and emotional learning (SEL) skills, and in turn, youth academic success.
